## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created QuoteFormContext for state management
2. ✅ Updated `submit-your-project.tsx` component with:
   - File upload functionality
   - Drag and drop interface
   - File validation
   - Project details textarea

3. ✅ Updated `contact-information.tsx` component with:
   - Form state management
   - Form validation
   - API integration

4. ✅ Created API endpoint at `/api/submit-quote-form/route.ts`:
   - Added file upload to SharePoint
   - Added Excel spreadsheet integration
   - Added validation logic

5. ✅ Created utility scripts:
   - `create-uploads-folder.js` - Creates folder for file uploads in SharePoint
   - `create-quote-excel-file.js` - Sets up Excel file with proper table structure

6. ✅ Added documentation:
   - `get-a-quote-form-setup.md` - Setup instructions for the new form

## Setup Instructions for Production

1. Run the setup scripts to prepare the SharePoint environment:
   ```bash
   ./setup-uploads-folder.sh
   ./setup-quote-excel.sh
   ```

2. Add the generated IDs to your environment variables:
   ```
   # For file uploads
   SHAREPOINT_UPLOADS_FOLDER_ID=your-folder-id

   # For Excel integration
   QUOTE_EXCEL_FILE_ID=your-excel-file-id
   QUOTE_EXCEL_WORKSHEET_NAME=QuoteRequests
   QUOTE_EXCEL_TABLE_NAME=QuoteFormSubmission
   ```

3. Restart the server to apply the changes

## Testing the Form

1. Navigate to the Get a Quote page
2. Try uploading different file types:
   - PDF document
   - Word document
   - Image files (JPG/PNG)
3. Test validation:
   - Submit with required fields empty
   - Submit with invalid email
   - Submit without checking acknowledgement
4. Test file size limits
5. Verify that submissions appear in the Excel spreadsheet
6. Verify that uploaded files are accessible via the links in the spreadsheet

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: The implementation includes basic file type and size validation to prevent abuse
- **Performance**: Large files are handled on the server side to avoid client-side performance issues
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for both client and server sides
- **User Experience**: Responsive design with clear feedback during submission

## Future Improvements

1. Add a confirmation email feature to notify users of successful quote submissions
2. Implement file preview functionality before submission
3. Add progress indicator during file upload for better user feedback
4. Enhance validation with more specific error messages
